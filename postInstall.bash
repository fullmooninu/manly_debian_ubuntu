#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -v

now, where i put that file with the beta version...?


# activate all repositories

# add repositories if needed

# dist-update

# install recommended drivers automatically

# dist-upgrade with suggests (test if --install-suggests has the same effect as that @install-suggests option for apt-get)

# install fonts and other media ubuntu shtuff

# install shtuff (skype etc, make a list) (all with suggests)

# you probably dont want to use ubuntu ppa, deb stuff seems more reliable.
